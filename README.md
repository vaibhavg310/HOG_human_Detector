# HOG_human_Detector

Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Human Detection project based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor. This project addresses the crucial task of detecting humans in images and videos, leveraging the power of HOG to capture distinctive visual cues that differentiate humans from other objects in diverse scenes.

Motivation
Human detection is a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to the variability in human appearance, pose, and background. The choice of a robust feature set is paramount for the effectiveness of an object detector. The HOG feature descriptor has emerged as a powerful solution, offering a comprehensive representation of human characteristics while being resilient to variations.
